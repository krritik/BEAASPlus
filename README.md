# BEAASPlus
This repository contains the sample code for the BEAAS+. Some of the contents include sample codes for smart contracts, protocol api, sample flask app.

### smartContracts
This folder contains the sample implementations for smart contracts used in the BEAAS+. The latest version of this already deployed in Rinkeby network at https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xf022657bfd61c1f48e00413ad2f5038dfb0eea53.

### BEAASPlusProtocol and protocolDeploy
This folder contains the code for the BEAAS+ Prototype implementation and its deployment details. 
TestPyPI Link - https://test.pypi.org/project/BEAASPlus/

### demoFlaskApp
This folder contains the demo flask app for implementing and verifying the prototype implementation. One can install the dependencies using the requirements.txt in the folder and run it locally to test it. Some of the configurations need to be updated such as a sql-database information for ABAC components, ethereum rinkeby externally owned address with and its private key for making transactions on blockchain.
